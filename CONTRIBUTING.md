# How to contribute

Zumly is a community-driven project and your contribution matters.

If you haven't already, come find us in [our Telegram group](https://t.me/ZumlyCommunity). We want you working on things you're excited about.

## Testing

[Most of our tests](https://github.com/zumly/zumly/tree/master/__tests__) are unit-tests written with Jest. Please write Spec examples for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Zumly](https://github.com/zumly/zumly/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 
When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include spec test. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. Besides, an [.editorconfig](https://github.com/zumly/zumly/blob/master/.editorconfig) is provided.

Thanks,

Juan Mart√≠n Muda
